        One of my favorite anime series is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece"
        title = "One Piece Wikipedia Page"> One Piece</a>. With a 26 year manga serialization and
        the anime airing for 23 years, spanning over 100 volumes and 1000 episodes, this <strong>pirate-themed epic fantasy</strong> series 
        has become the most sold manga worldwide with over <strong>500 million</strong> copies sold. 
        Although the sheer length of the series hinders accessibility for new readers and watchers, it is definitely
        worthwhile as it has been able to captivate many people through its well structured 
        story, characters, world building, themes, and emotional peaks.
        The episode 1000 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM7x1PNZDo0" title = "One Piece Ep.1000 OP"> opening</a>
        is one of my favorites as it celebrates this milestone with a special version of the first opening theme.
